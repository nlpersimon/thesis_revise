chapter{3. THE TRITUS SYSTEM}

Submitting natural language questions (e.g., “How do I tie shoelaces?”) to search engines in their original form often does not work very well. Search engines typically retrieve documents similar to the original queries. Unfortunately, the documents with the best answers may contain only one or two terms from the original queries. Such useful documents may then be ranked low by the search engine, and will never be examined by typical users who do not look beyond the first page of results. To answer a natural language question, a promising approach is to automatically reformulate the question into a query that con- tains terms and phrases that are expected to appear in documents containing answers to the original question.

section{3.1 Problem Statement}

We focus on the first step of the question answering process: retrieving a set of documents likely to contain an answer to a given question. These documents are then returned as the output of the system. The returned documents can be examined by a human user directly, or passed on to sophisticated answer extrac- tion modules of a question answering system (e.g., Abney et al. [2000], Mann [2002], Prager et al. [2002], and Radev et al. [2002]). Thus, it is crucial that the answer to a question of interest be present in this set of initially retrieved docu- ments. At the same time, the set of retrieved documents cannot be so large that it overwhelms the user or the subsequent (typically computationally expensive) answer extraction components. Therefore, our goal is to return a reasonable- sized set of documents that, at the same time, must contain an answer to the question. We now formally state the problem that we are addressing.

section{3.2 Learning to Transform Questions into Effective Queries}

We attempt to find transformations from natural language questions into ef- fective queries that contain terms or phrases expected to appear in documents that contain answers to the question. Our learning process is shown in Figure 2.

subsection{3.2.1 Selecting Question Phrases.}

In the first stage of the learning process (Step (1) in Figure 2), we generate a set of phrases that identify different cat- egories of questions where the questions in each category have a similar goal. For example, the question “What is a hard disk?” implies that the user is look- ing for definitions or descriptions of a hard disk. The goal of the question can be inferred from the question phrase “what is a”.
